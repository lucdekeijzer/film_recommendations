To use this program on a private cloud: 
Download the "deployment" folder and install the requirements in requirementes.txt. 

To replicate the server setup, AI.py and intents.json need to be on the server, and the rest of the files go on the client PC. The server computer needs
to be setup as an OpenSSH server and the client needs to be set up an OpenSSH client. PCSP, which comes with PuTTY is also needed.

When everything is ready, run Orchestrator_GUI on the client computer.

The orchestrator and interface components are implemented as separate modules in their respective .py files, 
but they both run on the client machine in our private cloud system.
